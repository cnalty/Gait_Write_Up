    <h2>Overview</h2> <!-- h2 is subtitles -->
        <p>
            &emsp;    The goal of the Gait DNA analysis project is to determine whether each individual in a video is walking
            freely, carrying a concealed object, or carrying a heavy object. This is done by first, preprocessing the
            videos with a pose identification network. Next each person’s torso is transformed upright and stabilized
            using the key points from the pose network. A new stabilized video is created for each person in a 1:2
            aspect ratio. All the key points from the network are also transformed. Using the transformed points a
            basin hopping algorithm is used to find a best fit of the form:
            <br><br>
            &emsp; a &bull; sin(b &bull; x + c) + d
            <br><br>
            This best fit is found for the shoulders, elbows, hands, knees and feet of each person. The network for
            identification is currently unfinished, but it will be taking in the amplitudes, period length, vertical
            offset and average height (pixels) for each person to identify if they are carrying.
        </p>
    <h2>Data Pre-Processing</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;    Before the proposed network will be able to identify carry there is some data we must extract, modify,
            and fit. First it requires a pose identification network to find each person in the video and identify key
            point coordinates on their body including: head, collar bone, shoulders, elbows, hands, hips, knees, and
            feet. Currently <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose">Open Pose</a>  is being used to
            extract this data from videos, giving us a list of people and their key points for each frame. From this
            list we then use the head, collarbone, and hip key points to align the torso and keep its position as
            similar as possible from frame to frame. We do this by finding a transform matrix that attempts to transform
            these points to preset locations every frame, then perform that transform on all of the points and the video.
            The new video produced for each person is a 1:2 ratio video with the person’s torso remaining still as their
            arms and legs swing freely(Figure x). Unfortunately this network seems to have trouble keeping consistent
            the ordering of people it finds from frame to frame, so the transforms are checked from one frame to the next
            to keep the correct points for each person.
            <br>
             &emsp;   Once we have the data points transformed outliers must be removed before we can acquire the final
            signals. Currently only y-point values are considered. This is because regardless of a walking direction in
            relation to the camera, an up and down motion can be seen from y-points. Unlike in the x-points, variation
            can not be see if the walking direction is towards the camera. First any extreme outliers are removed, those
            outside two one and a half standard deviations of the y-points. Next, we check three consecutive data points
            to, starting with points one, two and three, sliding over by one until we reach the last three points. A line
            is made between the first and third points, using y-value and frame number as coordinates, and the orthogonal
            distance of the second point to the line is checked. Any points found with a large orthogonal distance are
            removed from the list.
            <br>
             &emsp;   The final step is to find a best fit sine wave for the data points. This is done by using a basin hopping
            algorithm to minimize the residual of a fit line of the form:
            <br><br>
             &emsp;   a &bull; sin(b &bull; x + c) + d
            <br><br>
            Basin hopping is used, because it was found that simple linear regressions had a lot of trouble with local
            minimums trying when fitting with a sine function. Once we acquire values for a, b, c, and d they are
            written to a file to be used for the network’s inputs. The mean height (in pixels) of the person is also
            written to the file to give context to the amplitude of the wave.

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
           &emsp; Currently a more consistent outlier removal algorithm is being worked on. While the current algorithm used
            does a fairly good job of removing outliers (see figure x). A few methods are being tried, including:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tweaking the maximum orthogonal distance requirement for the current method</li>
                <li>Removing a few of the largest distance point and applying basin hopping multiple times to find a
                    curve that does not change from removing extra points
                </li>
                <li>Varying the acceptable orthogonal distance based on the slope of the line between points one and
                    three in the current triplet method</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            &emsp; One of the biggest challenges for the current method is consecutive outliers. When there is only one
            outlier surrounded by acceptable points, this method works very well, because the distance from the line created by
            the surrounding points will be very high compared to normally. However when there are multiple outliers in a row
            they create a line where the first outlier is very close to the line created by the last acceptable point and the
            next outlier (Figure x). In addition many of the outliers tend to fall on a flat line, meaning three or more in a
            row will create a scenario with the middle point being seemingly a perfect fit. The three methods listed are hoping
            to help combat this issue.
            <br>
            &emsp; In addition the network used for identification has not been built yet. In the next couple of months
            the plan is to have the pre-processing completely finished. Once this is finished data labeling and network
            construction will begin.
